# IndieGala Giveaways - Auto-join user script
User script to auto-join giveaways on indiegala.com

## Instalation
- Install Tamperonkey or any other plugin for user script to your browser

## Usage

- Edit the settings at the start of the script based on your liking
- Enable the script in the plugin settings
- Visit the page https://www.indiegala.com/giveaways/1/expiry/asc
- Disable the script once you are finished

### What it does / how it works?
Scrcipt detects that is at https://www.indiegala.com/giveaways/1/expiry/asc
Detects all the giveaways, assess the settings - if wants to join the giveaway opens the 
giveaway in the new tab and enters it, closes the window. So keep in mind that if you are at
https://www.indiegala.com/giveaways/detail/xxx and the scipt is enabled it's going to enter that
giveway imideatelly. 

## Warning
**Use this script at your own risk. Might violate IndieGala TOS.**
Also don't be pathetic and don't abuse giveaways. Enjoy this IndieGala feature and just use the script to save your time.
